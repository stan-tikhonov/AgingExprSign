#to index a genome you need to download a .dna.toplevel.fa.gz file from the latest genome release,
#and the .gtf (without chr or anything else)(you can download both from Ensembl using wget)
#then make a directory for the genome and go there
#fasta file should be located in the fasta directory within the genome directory, gtf file in the gtf directory
#make sure to unzip them both prior to lauching STAR
#make star_indexed directory for output files
#finally, run STAR indexer inside the genome directory:
STAR --runThreadN 8 --runMode genomeGenerate --genomeDir ./star_indexed/ --genomeFastaFiles ./fasta/Rattus_norvegicus.Rn
or_6.0.dna.toplevel.fa --sjdbGTFfile ./gtf/Rattus_norvegicus.Rnor_6.0.98.gtf          #(taking 16 threads for this is OK)
#you can add --limitGenomeGenerateRAM ################# in case the genome is too large for the default RAM limit
